# Bootstrap Grid Builds

This is a repo to house a mechanism that admins can use to create CSS grid layouts. The HTML utilizes elements from the Bootstrap library.

## Challenges include:

1. Creating start/restart options
2. Provide options to save current setting
3. Add/remove rows and columns

## Enhancements to consider:

1. Build support for customizing name and value pairs for breakpoints other than 'Desktop','Tablet','Mobile'
2. Create support for add/remove of rows and columns that are not last-of-type and have the grid recalculate the row and column indexes
3. Add error handling for when rows or columns do not conform to CSS grid specifications
4. Provide more documentation to inform as admin works with the tool
